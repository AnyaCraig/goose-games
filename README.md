# Goose Games

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and developed by Anya Craig

## To run this app

First, download this [JSON server](https://github.com/GooseChase/front-end-take-home-server) and run it with the following CLI command:

```
$> npx json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json
```

Make sure the server is running on port 3000.

Then, from the root of this project, run the following CLI command:

```
npm start
```

A message will ask you if you want to run the project on another port, since port 3000 is occupied by the JSON server. Type "y".

Then enjoy the app!
